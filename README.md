# **Coffin** - Common Object File Format Inspector 

## **WARNING** - Don't use this yet

<p>This is primarily a learning project for a not so young budding hobby developer.</p>
<p>The goals of this project are to learn C++ while making a hopefully useful application for the analysis of COFF files. </p> 
<p>Im a fairly experienced embedded developer in C and Assembly for multiple architectures.  </p>

[This Website](http://eldergeeks.dev/) is the website that this will eventually be hosted on. There is not much there either.</p>
